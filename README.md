# 🚗🔋 Electric Vehicle Charge and Range Analysis

## 📌 Abstract

This project provides comprehensive insights into the current state and future potential of electric vehicles (EVs) in India. Using **Tableau Public** as the primary visualization tool, the project integrates and analyzes multiple datasets covering:

* Charging infrastructure
* EV range and efficiency
* Plug types
* Vehicle pricing

The interactive dashboard reveals key patterns such as:

* Region-wise distribution of charging stations
* Availability of fast chargers
* Comparison of EV ranges by brand
* Affordability analysis of electric cars

These insights highlight gaps and opportunities in India’s EV ecosystem and assess regional readiness for EV adoption.
